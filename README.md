## Overview
The N-Queens problem is a problem of placing N queen pieces in a chessboard size N x N so that no queens overlap each other attack, i.e. no two queen pieces are lies in one row, one column, and one the same diagonal. In this project, we use depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find solutions to the N-Queens problem.
