## Overview
The 8-Queens problem is a problem of placing 8 queen pieces in a chessboard size 8 x 8 so that no queens overlap each other attack, i.e. no two queen pieces are lies in one row, one column, and one the same diagonal. In this project, we modified the problem a little bit. The number of queens can be 1-8, but the user can place the first queens anywhere on the chessboard. We use depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find solutions to the 8-Queens problem. The algorithm starts by placing the first queens anywhere arbitrarily and then place the next queen in any of the safe places. Then continue this process until the number of unplaced queens becomes zero (a solution is found) or no safe place is left. If no safe place is left, then we change the position of the previously placed queen.
